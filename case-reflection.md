### What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I think I had a pretty good grasp on the basic concepts. I know there is a lot more to uncover as things progress. I think I was struggling a bit with the conflict resolution between branches, but that became more clear after working through the GPS.


### What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Some of the merge conflict topic was clarified.


### What questions did you as your pair and the guide?

I only had a guide. I don't remember the exact questions I asked. I didn't have that many concerning the subject matter of the challenge. I did learn the basic command of "git branch" to list what branches you are currently available. I also learned about what more advanced workflow with git might look like.


### What still confuses you about git?

Some of the more complex branch merging still confuses me. Mainly how you would go about cleaning up and deciding what elements to merge in more complex files.


### How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It was good. I didn't have a pair, so it was more of a guided solo session, but was quite enjoyable.
